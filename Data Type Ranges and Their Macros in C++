Data Type Ranges and Their Macros in C++

Most of the times, in competitive programming, there is a need to assign the variable, the maximum or minimum value that data type can hold but remembering such a large and precise number comes out to be a difficult job. Therefore, C++ has certain macros to represent these numbers, so that these can be directly assigned to the variable without actually typing the whole number.

The <climits> header file in C++ defines macros that represent the upper and lower bounds of integer data types and <cfloat> defines the macros for float and double limits. These macros allow you to easily assign these extreme values to variables without manually typing them out.

Let’s take a look at an example:

#include <iostream>

// for int, char macros
#include <climits>

// for float, double macros
#include <cfloat>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    // Displaying ranges with the help of macros
    cout << "char ranges from: " << CHAR_MIN << " to "
         << CHAR_MAX << endl;

    cout << "\nnshort int ranges from: " << SHRT_MIN
         << " to " << SHRT_MAX << endl;
    cout << "\nint ranges from: " << INT_MIN << " to "
         << INT_MAX << endl;
    cout << "\nlong int ranges from: " << LONG_MIN << " to "
         << LONG_MAX << endl;
    cout << "\nfloat ranges from: " << FLT_MIN << " to "
         << FLT_MAX << endl;

    return 0;
}


Output

char ranges from: -128 to 127

nshort int ranges from: -32768 to 32767

int ranges from: -2147483648 to 2147483647

long int ranges from: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

float ranges from: 1.17549e-38 to 3.40282e+38




Data Type Limits in Modern C++


The above macro approach for the upper and lower limits of the data type is the old C language approach inherited by C++. But C++ also have its own method to provide programmers with the same information.

C++ offers the numeric_limits<> class template as a modern alternative to these macros. This template provides a more object-oriented approach for accessing data type limits. It is defined inside the <limits> header file.

Let’s take a look at an example:


#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    // Displaying ranges with the help of macros
    cout << "short int ranges from: " << numeric_limits<short int>::min()
         << " to " << numeric_limits<short int>::max() << endl;
    cout << "\nint ranges from: " << numeric_limits<int>::min() << " to "
         << numeric_limits<int>::max() << endl;
    cout << "\nlong int ranges from: " << numeric_limits<long>::min() << " to "
         << numeric_limits<long>::max() << endl;
    cout << "\nfloat ranges from: " << numeric_limits<float>::min() << " to "
         << numeric_limits<float>::max() << endl;

    return 0;
}


Output

short int ranges from: -32768 to 32767

int ranges from: -2147483648 to 2147483647

long int ranges from: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

float ranges from: 1.17549e-38 to 3.40282e+38
