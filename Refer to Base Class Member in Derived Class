Refer to Base Class Member in Derived Class

The scope resolution operator can also be used to refer to the members of base class in a derived class especially if they have the same name.


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void func() {
        cout << "Base class func()" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
  
      // Overridden function
    void func() {
        cout << "Derived class func()" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
  
      // Calling base class's func() from the object of
      // derived class
    obj.Base::func();
  
    obj.func();
    return 0;
}


Output
Base class func()
Derived class func()
