Variations of Scopes in C++

Apart from the primary classification of the scopes as global and local, there are few other specialized variations of these scopes that divides the declared variable based on its accessibility and visibility. Following are some common variations of variable scopes in C++.

Instance Scope
Static Member Scope
Namespace Scope


Instance Scope

In C++, instance scope refers to the region inside a class but outside any member function of the class. The variable declared here are called instance variables and are accessible to whole class. They can be accessed by the objects of the class.

Let’s look at an example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
  
      // Instance variable with instance scope i.e. accessible
      // in whole class
    int instanceVar;

    A(int val) {
        instanceVar = val;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << instanceVar << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  
      // Creates a1 with instanceVar = 10
    A a1(1);
    a1.display();

      // Creates a2 with instanceVar = 20
    A a2(33);
    a2.display();

    return 0;
}

Output
1
33

Static Member Scope

The static scope applies to variables and functions declared with the static keyword within the class. These variables are shared across all instances of a class and can be accessed using the class name without creating the instance.

Let’s take a look at an example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
  
      // Static variable with static scope i.e. accessible
      // in whole class
    static int staticVar;
};

int A::staticVar = 1;

int main() {
  
      // Access static variable
      cout << A::staticVar;

    return 0;
}

Output
1

Namespace Scope

A namespace in C++ is a container that allows users to create a separate scope where the given variables are defined. It is used to avoid name conflicts and group related code together. These variables can be then accessed using their namespace name and scope resolution operator.

For example, the below program creates a variable inside a namespace and access it later using namespace name and scope resolution operator.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

namespace N {
      
      // Variable with namespace scope
    int namespaceVar = 10;
}

int main() {
  
      // Access variable using namespace
    cout << N::namespaceVar;  

    return 0;
}

Output
10
