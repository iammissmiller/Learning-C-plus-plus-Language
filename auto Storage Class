auto Storage Class

The auto storage class is the default class of all the variables declared inside a block. The auto stands for automatic and all the local variables that are declared in a block automatically belong to this class.

Properties of auto Storage Class Objects

Scope: Local
Default Value: Garbage Value
Memory Location: RAM
Lifetime: Till the end of its scope

Letâ€™s take a look at an example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // Declaring an auto variable
    int a = 32;
    float b = 3.2;
    string c = "GeeksforGeeks";

    // Printing the auto variables
    cout << a << " \n";
    cout << b << " \n";
      cout << c << " \n";

    return 0;
}

Output
32 
3.2 
GeeksforGeeks

Note: Earlier in C++, we could use the auto keyword to declare the auto variables explicitly but after C++11, the meaning of auto keyword is changed, and we could no longer use it to define the auto variables.
