In C++, input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.

Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device (for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.

Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device (display screen) then this process is called output.

All of these streams are defined inside the <iostream> header file which contains all the standard input and output tools of C++. The two instances cout and cin of iostream class are used very often for printing outputs and taking inputs respectively. These two are the most basic methods of taking input and printing output in C++.


Standard Output Stream – cout

The C++ cout is the instance of the ostream class used to produce output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen. The data needed to be displayed on the screen is inserted in the standard output stream (cout) using the insertion operator(<<).

Syntax

cout << value/variable;


Standard Input Stream – cin

The C++ cin statement is the instance of the class istream and is used to read input from the standard input device which is usually a keyboard. The extraction operator (>>) is used along with the object cin for extracting the data from the input stream and store it in some variable in the program.

Syntax

cin >> variable;


Un-buffered Standard Error Stream – cerr

The C++ cerr is the standard error stream that is used to output the errors. This is also an instance of the iostream class. As cerr in C++ is un-buffered so it is used when one needs to display the error message immediately. It does not have any buffer to store the error message and display it later.

The main difference between cerr and cout comes when you would like to redirect output using “cout” that gets redirected to file if you use “cerr” the error doesn’t get stored in file.(This is what un-buffered means ..It cant store the message)

Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cerr << "An error occurred";
    return 0;
}

Error

An error occurred

Buffered Standard Error Stream – clog

This is also an instance of ostream class and used to display errors but unlike cerr the error is first inserted into a buffer and is stored in the buffer until it is not fully filled. or the buffer is not explicitly flushed (using flush()). The error message will be displayed on the screen too.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    clog << "An error occurred";
    return 0;
}

Error

An error occurred
