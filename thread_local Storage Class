thread_local Storage Class

The thread_local Storage Class is the new storage class that was added in C++11. We can use the thread_local storage class specifier to define the object as thread_local. The thread_local variable can be combined with other storage specifiers like static or extern and the properties of the thread_local object changes accordingly.

Properties of thread_local Storage Class

Memory Location: RAM
Lifetime: Till the end of its thread


Letâ€™s take a look at an example:


#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;

// Defining thread-local variable
thread_local int val = 10;

// Mutex for synchronization
mutex mtx;

int main() {
  
    // Created 3 threads
    // Modify value in thread 1
    thread th1([]() {
        val += 18;
        lock_guard<mutex> lock(mtx);
        cout << "Thread 1 value: " << val << '\n';
    });

    thread th2([]() {
      
        // Modify value in thread 2
        val += 7;
        lock_guard<mutex> lock(mtx);
        cout << "Thread 2 value: " << val << '\n';
    });

    thread th3([]() {
      
        // Modify value in thread 3
        val += 13;
        lock_guard<mutex> lock(mtx);
        cout << "Thread 3 value: " << val << '\n';
    });

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    th1.join();
    th2.join();
    th3.join();

    // Print the value of value in the main thread
    cout << "Main thread value: " << val << '\n';

    return 0;
}



Output

Thread 1 value Value: 28
Thread 2 value Value: 17
Thread 3 value Value: 23
Main thread value Value: 10


As we can see, each thread got its own copy of the thread_local variable and was only assigned the value that was specified in its callable.
