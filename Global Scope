Global Scope

Global scope refers to the region outside any function or a block. The variables declared here are accessible throughout the entire program and are called Global Variables.

Let’s take a look at an example:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Global variable
int global = 5;

// Global variable accessed from within
// a function
void display() {
    cout << global << endl;
}

int main() {
    display();
    
    // Changing value of global from main
      // function before calling display()
    global = 10;
    display();
  
      return 0;
}

Output
5
10

Explanation: In the program, the variable “global” is declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions so it is a global variable and can be accessed or updated from anywhere in the program.
