static Storage Class

The static storage class is used to declare static variables that have the property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope. They are initialized only once and exist until the termination of the program. Thus, no new memory is allocated because they are not re-declared. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program but unlike extern variable, they have internal linkage so they cannot be accessed outside the program.

They are declared using static keyword.

Properties of static Storage Class

Scope: Local
Default Value: Zero
Memory Location: RAM
Lifetime: Till the end of the program

Letâ€™s take a look at an example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function containing static variables
// memory is retained during execution
int func() {
  
      // Static variable
    static int count = 0;
    count++;
    return count;
}

int main() {
    cout << func() << "\n";
    cout << func();
    
    return 0;
}
